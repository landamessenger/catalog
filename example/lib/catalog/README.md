# Catalog in example

This is your catalog in example. It shows the widgets that contain `@Preview` in the header.

You should not manipulate it yourself. If you observe any unexpected behavior please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/landamessenger/catalog/issues). We will try to fix it as soon as possible.

Generate dummies, previews (override every time) with:

```bash
dart run catalog:preview
```

All the above plus catalog generation.

```bash
dart run catalog:build
```
